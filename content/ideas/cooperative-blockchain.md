A cooperative is an association between individuals united voluntarily under a common goal. They are own in a democracy; All business decision is relevant to all information is shared. The individuals form a unit.

A usual association is one of the small farmers, which alone they could not take their products to scale and compete with larger farmers, but together they form a unique brand with mass production. Cooperative does have benefits compared to larger farmers; The soil can have its crop rotated to fertilize it, while a group of farmers produces another type of crop.

## Blockchain

A  ledger that is decentralized, no single owner of the registry holding all authority and data, to implement such features it uses cryptographic hashes (computer-generated sequence of letters and numbers based on the contents of the registry) that guarantee that no record is altered after being commited .

## How cooperatives benefit from it?

Each individual is a unit collectively achieving a goal. They should hold information that is concerned with everyone. Decentralizing guarantees that no one corrupts any material.

Decisions made by the elected board of directors can be tracked and be final; a great way to view it is each one covers the other's back, instead of thinking that everyone is suspect of malicious intent.

The possibility to track the origin of products is present with a blockchain. It is possible to pinpoint where it is producing any defective output and correct it without delay.
