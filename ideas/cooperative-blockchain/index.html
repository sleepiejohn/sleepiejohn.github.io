The natural decentralization of Cooperatives fits nicely into a Blockchain.

Cooperative does have benefits compared to larger farmers; The soil can have its crop rotated to fertilize it, while a group of farmers produces another type of crop.</p><h2 id=blockchain>Blockchain</h2><p>A ledger that is decentralized, no single owner of the registry holding all authority and data, to implement such features it uses cryptographic hashes (computer-generated sequence of letters and numbers based on the contents of the registry) that guarantee that no record is altered after being commited .</p><h2 id=how-cooperatives-benefit-from-it>How cooperatives benefit from it?</h2><p>Each individual is a unit collectively achieving a goal. They should hold information that is concerned with everyone. Decentralizing guarantees that no one corrupts any material.</p><p>Decisions made by the elected board of directors can be tracked and be final; a great way to view it is each one covers the other&rsquo;s back, instead of thinking that everyone is suspect of malicious intent.</p><p>The possibility to track the origin of products is present with a blockchain. It is possible to pinpoint where it is producing any defective output and correct it without delay.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/sleepiejohn title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|⚡️
